This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/trellix-epo/) on n8n's website.

## Using basic auth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Username** to connect as.
- A **Password** for that user account.

n8n uses These fields to build the `-u` parameter in the format of `-u username:pw`. Refer to [Web API basics](https://docs.trellix.com/bundle/epolicy-orchestrator-web-api-reference-guide/page/GUID-2503B69D-2BCE-4491-9969-041838B39C1F.html) for more information.
