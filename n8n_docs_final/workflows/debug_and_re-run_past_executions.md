# Debug and re-run past executions

Feature availability

Available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

You can load data from a previous execution into your current workflow. This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.

## Load data

To load data from a previous execution:

1. In your workflow, select the **Executions** tab to view the **Executions** list.
2. Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
   - For failed executions: select **Debug in editor**.
   - For successful executions: select **Copy to editor**.
3. n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and [pins the data](../../../data/data-pinning/) in the first node in the workflow.

Check which executions you save

The executions available on the **Executions** list depends on your [Workflow settings](../../settings/).
